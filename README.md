    # Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
    # between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
    # The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
ex2
    # Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
    # The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320

    # With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i x i)
    # such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included).
    # and then the program should print the dictionary
ex4
    # Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list
    # and a tuple which contains every number.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program
ex5
    # Define a class which has at least two methods:
    # getString: to get a string from console input
    # printString: to print the string in upper case.
    # Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.
ex6
    # Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
    # Q = Square root of [(2 *C*D)/H]
    # D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
ex7
    # Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array.
    # The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.
ex8
    # Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input
    # and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

ex11
    # Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and
    # then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
